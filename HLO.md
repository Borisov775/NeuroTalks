<h2>High-Level Overview</h2>
This web app is inspired by the creative sites referring to the development of BCI like neuralink.com, neiry-bci.com.
Moreover, I find the theme of BCI* very attractive to me, I do intend to create or help to create the startup.
So this web app is like a fundament for my future career. I decided to create an app that will be used as a site for the startup and as a
kinda blog where scientist, neuroscientist, engineers, I mean everyone who works in this sphere could post their own ideas, thoughts, and proposals absolutely free.
