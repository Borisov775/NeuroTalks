# Neuro-BioTalks

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the 21 century, there are thousands of research works and communities that dedicate their time to exploring the biology of our brain. 
Those works have been started at about 50 years ago, but the most significant steps will take a place in the nearest future. Luckily we have more and more startups willing to take a part in creating technologies that potentially could make our medicine more capable to help people with brain damages, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. We could use those technologies in many kinds of humankind's activities, for example, astronauts using non-implanted BCI could remote control the manipulator instead of going out in space to catch radiation. All in all, I think Biotechnologies in collaboration with Engineering and Neuroscience could make our future better and healthier.
<h1>High-Level Overview</h1>
This web application is dedicated to providing a platform for sharing knowledge, ideas, thoughts in researching the biology of the brain, engineering of the brain, creation of BCI, and other topics relating to brain researches or just Biotechnologies(maybe genetics in the future updatings). Here you could connect, collaborate with people who have a common interest in the subject. You could create your group of people for startup and post a story about your innovative idea with the ability to fund your project. Here you could ask any professor or specialist for advice in a comfortable way. Also, you could share a link to video conference and provide coverage of your lesson all around the world which I think it's great for educational purpose. I do intend to invest my time in developing a fundamental platform for activity in BioTechologies, especially in Neuroscience.
<h2> Benefits of Neuro-BioTalks</h2>
<ul>
<li><b> Access to the works of other research teams</b></li>
<li><b>Collaboration and connection</b></li>
<li><b> A capability to store definite (which you are interested in) works in your account</b></li>
<li><b> Great educational resources for growing like a specialist</b></li>
<li><b> Here you could know more about BCI and other hardware<b></li>
<li><b>A place for inspiration, you could share your ideas, thoughts referring to your field of researching</li><b>
</ul> 
<h2> Functional details</h2>
<h3>Signing up</h3>
There are three types of user:
<ul>
<li><b>Guest(can't see anything, until sign up or log in)</b></li>
<li><b>User(can use all functional, except publushing works in a global view)</b></li>
<li><b>Publisher(can publish a research works,create links for meetings)</b></li>
</ul>
For singing up you need to create a new login and password or you can sign in with Google,Twitter and Facebook.
In order to become a publisher you send a request after signing up like a User.
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<b>IN THE DEVELOPMENT(DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION I WILL BE UPDATING THIS PARAGRAPH)</b>
<p>
In a nutshell, every user will have an account. But the main actions will be procceding on the main page(HOME). They may like post, marked it.On this page 
users will be posting your works, links for the meetings, ideas. User serfing through these resources could attach to BOOKMARKS all what they find interesting. Also every user can become a publisher which means they may write a post.  
<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Primary languages: Java,HTML</b></li>
<li><b>Web-Server: Apache</b></li>
<li><b>Database: MariaDB</b></li>
</ul>
